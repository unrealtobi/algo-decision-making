# Decision Making and Recursion Tasks

This repository contains a set of tasks implemented using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The tasks include both decision making (if-else and switch) and recursion concepts.

## Decision Making Tasks

### Leap Year Checker
- This task checks whether a given year is a leap year or not.
- It prompts the user to enter a year and determines if it meets the criteria for a leap year.

### Ticket Pricing
- This task calculates the price of a movie ticket based on the user's age.

### Weather Clothing Adviser
- This task provides clothing advice based on the current temperature and weather condition (rain).
- It prompts the user to enter the temperature and whether it's raining, then advises on appropriate clothing.

## Recursion Tasks

### Fibonacci Sequence
- This task generates the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.
- It prompts the user to enter a number and calculates the corresponding Fibonacci number recursively.

### Palindrome Checker
- This task checks if a given string is a palindrome using recursion.
- It prompts the user to enter a string and determines if it reads the same forwards and backwards, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

### Power Function
- This task calculates the result of raising a number to a given power using recursion.
- It prompts the user to enter the base number and the exponent, then calculates the result recursively.
